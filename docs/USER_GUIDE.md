## Getting Started

### First Run (with sample data)

No setup required. Explore all features immediately:

```bash
niyantra demo     # Seeds 2 accounts, 24 snapshots, 5 subscriptions
niyantra serve    # Open http://localhost:9222
```

### First Run (with real data)

1. Make sure Antigravity IDE is running with a project open
2. Run your first snapshot:

```bash
niyantra snap     # Captures your account's quota (1 API call to localhost)
niyantra serve    # Dashboard at http://localhost:9222
```

You should see your account appear in the Quotas tab with per-model progress bars.

---

## Quota Tracking

### What Gets Captured

Each snapshot records:
- **Account email** and plan name
- **Per-model quotas**: remaining percentage, reset time, and exhaustion status
- **AI Credits**: Live Google One AI credit balances tracked alongside your limit resets
- **Provenance**: how, when, and where the data was captured

### Models Tracked

Antigravity exposes per-model quotas. Niyantra groups them into 3 logical pools:

| Group | Models | Color |
|-------|--------|-------|
| **Claude + GPT** | Claude Sonnet, GPT-4.1, etc. | Orange |
| **Gemini Pro** | Gemini 2.5 Pro | Green |
| **Gemini Flash** | Gemini 2.5 Flash | Blue |

Each pool has independent 5-hour rolling quotas that reset independently.

### Manual Snap

```bash
niyantra snap              # Capture current account
niyantra snap --debug      # Verbose output (useful for troubleshooting detection)
```

Or use the dashboard's **split-button snap**:
- **Snap Now** (primary button) — captures the current Antigravity account
- **▾ Snap All Sources** (dropdown) — captures Antigravity + Codex + Claude in one click

### Status Check (offline)

```bash
niyantra status            # Shows all accounts, no network calls
```

Output shows a readiness grid: which accounts are ready, which are exhausted, when resets happen.

### Quick Adjust (Manual Correction)

The LS cache data may be up to ~2 minutes stale. After snapping, you can fine-tune quota values:

**Group-level** (main grid view):
- Hover over any quota group cell (Claude+GPT / Gemini Pro / Gemini Flash)
- **−5** and **+5** buttons appear below the minibar
- Click to adjust ALL models in that group by ±5%

**Model-level** (expanded view):
- Click an account row to expand, then hover over any model row
- **−10**, **−5**, **+5**, **+10** buttons appear after the percentage
- Click to adjust that specific model

Adjustments are saved to the database immediately and recalculate group-level aggregates. Use this when you know you've used more quota than the cached LS data reflects.

---

## Dashboard

Launch with `niyantra serve` and open `http://localhost:9222`.

### Quotas Tab

The default view showing all tracked accounts organized by **provider sections**.

**Provider Sections**: Accounts are grouped into collapsible sections:
- **Antigravity** — quota snapshots from the Antigravity Language Server
- **Codex / ChatGPT** — multi-window quota data from OpenAI OAuth API
- **Claude Code** — rate limit data from the statusline bridge + deep JSONL token analytics
- **Cursor** — request counts and USD credit balance
- **Gemini CLI** — rate limit tracking via GCP APIs
- **Copilot** — GitHub billing data

Each section has its own header with provider color coding and can be collapsed/expanded.

**Toolbar**:
- **Search**: Fuzzy search by email or plan name
- **Provider filter**: Dropdown to show All / Antigravity / Codex / Claude / Cursor / Gemini / Copilot accounts
- **Status filter**: Filter by readiness state — Ready (green), Low (yellow), Empty (red)

## Subscription Manager

### 26 Platform Presets

When adding a subscription, choose from built-in presets:

| Category | Platforms |
|----------|-----------|
| **AI Coding** | Antigravity, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Codex/ChatGPT |
| **AI Chat** | Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity |
| **AI API** | OpenAI API, Anthropic API, Google AI Studio |
| **AI Creative** | Midjourney, Runway, ElevenLabs, Suno, DALL-E |
| **AI Productivity** | Notion AI, Grammarly, Jasper |
| **AI DevTools** | Replit, Tabnine, Codeium, v0 |

Each preset pre-fills the platform name, category, and typical pricing. You can customize everything.

### Subscription Statuses

- **Active**: Currently paying
- **Trial**: Free trial (set trial end date to get renewal alerts)
- **Paused**: Temporarily suspended
- **Cancelled**: No longer paying

### Editing and Deleting

Click any subscription card to edit its details. Use the delete button to remove it.

---

## Budget & Forecasting

### Setting Your Budget

1. Go to **Settings** tab
2. Enter your monthly AI budget (e.g., $150)
3. The Overview tab will now show:
   - Current spend vs budget
   - Projected end-of-month spend
   - Warning if you're on track to exceed budget

### How Forecasting Works

Niyantra calculates your daily burn rate from active subscriptions and projects it across the remaining days in the month. This is a simple linear projection — it doesn't account for variable usage-based billing.

---

## Auto-Capture

### Enabling

1. Go to **Settings** tab
2. Toggle **Auto-Capture** to ON
3. Set polling interval (default: 60 seconds)

### How It Works

When enabled, Niyantra polls all configured data sources at your configured interval. Each poll:
1. Fetches quota data via one HTTP call (with `*float64` protobuf handling for precise quota values)
2. Stores the snapshot with provenance tag `capture_method: auto`
3. Detects reset cycles (when quotas jump back up)
4. Updates session tracking
5. Triggers notifications if thresholds are breached
6. If Codex is enabled, polls Codex API in the same cycle
7. If Claude bridge is enabled, reads statusline data in the same cycle

### Safety

- **Zero-daemon by default**: Auto-capture only runs when explicitly enabled AND `niyantra serve` is running
- **No background service**: Stops when you close the dashboard
- **One call per poll**: Each poll makes exactly 1 HTTP call to localhost
- **Exponential backoff**: If detection fails, wait time increases to avoid hammering the process list

---

## Switch Advisor

The switch advisor helps you choose which Antigravity account to use when you have multiple accounts.

### How Scoring Works

Each account gets a score (0-100) based on three factors:

| Factor | Weight | What it measures |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Remaining % | 60% | Average remaining quota across all model groups |
| Burn Rate | 20% | How fast you're consuming (from usage intelligence) |
| Reset Time | 20% | How soon the lowest quota resets |

### Actions

- **"switch"**: Another account scores significantly higher. Switch to it.
- **"stay"**: Current account is best (or close enough). Keep using it.
- **"wait"**: All accounts are exhausted, but one resets soon. Wait for it.

### Accessing

- **Dashboard**: Overview tab shows the advisor recommendation
- **CLI**: Data is shown in status output
- **MCP**: AI agents can call `switch_recommendation` tool

---

## MCP Server

Niyantra exposes 13 tools to AI coding agents via the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).

### Setup

**Stdio Transport** (local agents):

Add to your MCP client config:

**Claude Desktop** (`~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "niyantra": {
      "command": "niyantra",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Streamable HTTP Transport** (remote agents):

Connect to `POST /mcp` on the running dashboard server. Supports SSE streaming and session management via `Mcp-Session-Id` header.

### Available Tools (12)

| Tool | What you can ask |
|------|-----------------|
| `quota_status` | "What's my Antigravity quota and AI Credits balance?" |
| `model_availability` | "Is Claude Sonnet available?" |
| `usage_intelligence` | "How fast am I burning quota?" |
| `budget_forecast` | "Will I stay under budget this month?" |
| `best_model` | "Which model has the most quota?" |
| `analyze_spending` | "Break down my AI spending by category" |
| `switch_recommendation` | "Should I switch accounts?" |
| `codex_status` | "What's my Codex/ChatGPT status?" |
| `quota_forecast` | "When will my Antigravity quota groups exhaust at current rate?" |
| `token_usage_stats` | "How many Claude Code tokens did I use today?" |
| `copilot_status` | "What is my GitHub Copilot premium/chat usage?" |
| `git_commit_costs` | "What did my last feature branch cost?" |
| `plugin_status` | "What's the latest data from my plugins?" |

### Running

```bash
niyantra mcp    # Starts MCP server on stdio (meant for MCP clients, not direct use)
```

The MCP server reads from the same SQLite database as the dashboard. It makes **zero network calls** — all data comes from previously captured snapshots.

---

## Codex/ChatGPT Integration

### How It Works

Niyantra can poll the Codex/ChatGPT API to track multi-window quotas:
- **5-hour window**: Rolling quota for recent usage
- **7-day window**: Weekly quota limit
- **Code review**: Separate quota for code review features

### Setup

1. Niyantra auto-detects credentials from `~/.codex/auth.json`
2. Enable in **Settings** tab > Codex section
3. When auto-capture is on, Codex is polled alongside Antigravity

### Dashboard

The **Overview** tab shows a Codex status card with all three quota windows and their current usage. If OIDC JWT contains profile data, the card also shows the account's display name and profile picture.

---

## Claude Code

### Statusline Bridge

Monitors Claude Code's rate limit data via a statusline bridge. This patches Claude Code's settings to expose rate limit information.

1. Enable in **Settings** tab > Claude Code Bridge
2. Niyantra patches `~/.claude/settings.json` to add statusline data
3. Rate limit data (5h/7d meters) appears in the dashboard

### Deep Token Tracking

Niyantra parses Claude Code's JSONL session logs for detailed token analytics:
- Per-turn input/output/cache token counts
- Model-aware cost estimation using configured model pricing
- Daily aggregated views in the Token Usage section

---

## Cursor Integration

Niyantra tracks Cursor usage via the `cursor.com/api/usage` endpoint.

1. Detects session token from `~/.cursor-server/` filesystem
2. Enable in **Settings** tab > Cursor section
3. Tracks both legacy request-based and new USD credit-based billing models

---

## Gemini CLI Integration

Niyantra tracks Gemini CLI usage via GCP APIs.

1. Detects OAuth credentials from `~/.config/gemini/`
2. Enable in **Settings** tab > Gemini CLI section
3. Uses 2-step API (loadCodeAssist + retrieveUserQuota) for rate limit data

---

## GitHub Copilot Integration

Niyantra tracks GitHub Copilot usage via the GitHub billing API.

1. Create a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)
2. Enter in **Settings** tab > Copilot section (PAT is masked in API responses)
3. Usage metrics are tracked and displayed

---

## Notifications

Niyantra supports **quad-channel notifications** when quotas drop below your configured threshold.

### Channel 1: OS-Native Alerts

| OS | Method |
|----|--------|
| Windows | .NET BalloonTip notification |
| macOS | `osascript` notification |
| Linux | `notify-send` |

### Channel 2: SMTP Email (F11)

Pure Go SMTP client supporting plain, STARTTLS, and TLS encryption. Sends HTML-formatted emails with model details and quota percentages.

Configure in **Settings** > SMTP Email section (host, port, user, pass, from, to, TLS mode).

### Channel 3: Webhooks (F22)

Multi-service webhook delivery with 4 service adapters:
- **Discord** — Rich embed with severity color
- **Telegram** — HTML-formatted via Bot API
- **Slack** — Attachment with color coding
- **Generic** — Plain text with headers (ntfy/Gotify/custom)

### Channel 4: WebPush (F19)

Browser push notifications using VAPID (RFC 8292) + RFC 8291 encryption.
- Works on Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari 16+
- Subscribe via **Settings** > WebPush section
- Notifications arrive even when the dashboard tab is closed
- VAPID keys auto-generated on first subscribe

### Configuration

1. **Settings** tab > Notifications sections
2. Toggle ON the channels you want
3. Set threshold (e.g., 20% — notify when any quota drops below 20%)
4. Click **Test** on any channel to verify

### Once-Per-Cycle Guard

Notifications fire once per reset cycle, not every poll. All 4 channels fire independently and asynchronously.

### Digest Mode (F8)

Instead of receiving individual alerts for each quota breach, enable **Digest Mode** to batch multiple alerts into a single summary notification:
- Configurable window (default: 5 minutes)
- Early flush at 5 accumulated alerts
- Delivers via all 4 channels simultaneously
- Thread-safe batch-on-write pattern

---

## Command Palette

Press **Ctrl+K** (or **Cmd+K** on Mac) anywhere in the dashboard to open the command palette.

### Available Commands

- Snap Now, Toggle Auto-Capture, Switch Theme
- Export CSV, Export JSON, Import JSON, Download Backup
- Navigate tabs (Quotas, Subscriptions, Overview, Settings)
- Add Subscription, Test Notification

### Fuzzy Search

Type to filter commands. The palette uses fuzzy matching, so typing "exp" matches "Export CSV", "Export JSON", etc.

---

## Data Management

### Backup

```bash
niyantra backup                              # Creates timestamped backup
niyantra backup --db ~/.niyantra/niyantra.db # Specify database
```

Or use the **Settings** tab > Download Backup button.

Backups are saved as `niyantra-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.db` in the current directory.

### Restore

```bash
niyantra restore ./niyantra-backup-20260419-120000.db
```

The restore command validates the schema before replacing your database.

### JSON Export

**Settings** tab > Export JSON — downloads all data (accounts, subscriptions, snapshots, config, activity log) as a single JSON file.

### JSON Import

**Settings** tab > Import JSON — uploads a JSON file and merges data with additive deduplication:
- Accounts are matched by email (no duplicates)
- Subscriptions are matched by platform + email
- Snapshots are matched by account + timestamp
- Existing data is never overwritten or deleted

### API Payload Extraction

To view the raw JSON data returned from the Antigravity Language Server, use the payload extraction script:
```bash
go run scripts/dump_antigravity_payload.go
```
This will extract the most recent unmarshalled data from the database and save it to `antigravity_payload_dump.json` in the current directory.

### Clear Snapshots

To clear all quota history for a specific account:
1. Go to **Quotas** tab
2. Click the account row to expand it
3. Click **Clear Snapshots**
4. Confirm in the dialog

The account itself remains — only snapshot history is deleted.

### Remove Account

To permanently delete a tracked account and all its data:
1. Go to **Quotas** tab
2. Click the account row to expand it
3. Click **Remove Account**
4. Confirm in the dialog

This cascade-deletes the account, all snapshots, reset cycles, and codex snapshots. The next time you `snap` with this email, it will be re-created as a fresh account.
