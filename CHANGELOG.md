# Changelog

All notable changes to Niyantra are documented here.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Versions map to feature milestones, not semver.

## [Unreleased]

### Security
- Dashboard API token is now mandatory for all `/api/*` and HTTP `/mcp` requests. `niyantra serve` prints a tokenized first-open URL, and `niyantra token show|rotate` manages the token.
- Dashboard and CLI backups now redact sensitive config values from the copied SQLite database, including the dashboard token, provider credentials, notification secrets, and plugin secret-like keys.
- Manual HTTP plugin execution is removed from the product surface. `POST /api/plugins/{id}/run` now returns `410 Gone` and never spawns a process.
- Plugin discovery rejects oversized manifests, manifest symlinks, and entry points resolving outside the plugin directory.

### Fixed
- **Antigravity V2 multi-process detection** — complete overhaul of LS detection for the new Antigravity stack (Main, IDE Hub, IDE Workspace). Three bugs resolved:
  - **Context cancel race condition** — `cancel()` was called after `Do()` but before `ReadAll()`, killing the HTTP connection mid-read. Moved `cancel()` after body is fully consumed.
  - **Port selection/CSRF mismatch** — blind netstat port scanning could connect to the extension server port (which uses `--extension_server_csrf_token`) with the wrong CSRF token (`--csrf_token`). Now uses a 3-strategy prioritized probing: HTTPS port → extension server port (with correct CSRF) → netstat fallback.
  - **Stale account after IDE account switch** — the old process-level dedup preferred workspace processes (which keep the old account after a switch) over hub processes (which have the new account). Replaced with instance-level dedup in FetchQuotas: hub connections are processed first, and once a tool instance returns data, subsequent processes from the same instance are skipped.
- Schema v21 repairs legacy sentinel/dangling references and rebuilds affected tables with nullable FK-backed relationships.
- Advisor output ranks accounts when no current account is supplied and only gives switch guidance with explicit current-account context.
- Reset-time elapsed no longer converts exhausted quotas into observed availability; estimated/unknown data is labeled with quality metadata.
- **Post-reset quota estimation engine rewrite** — `ApplyResetInference` now produces optimistic 100% estimates after sprint reset (matching Google's actual behavior). Previously, exhausted accounts that had reset would still show 0% and score poorly in the advisor, defeating the core account-switching feature. New 4-tier graduated confidence: `high` (<30 min since reset), `medium` (<6h), `low` (<24h), `very_low` (>24h, keeps original values). UI badges differentiate "Reset Est." from "Stale" and "Very Stale".
- **Multi-provider post-reset estimation** — estimation engine extended to all 4 non-Antigravity providers, each using its actual reset mechanics: Codex/Claude Code (rolling 5h+7d window recovery → usage resets to 0% used), Cursor (monthly billing cycle → all counters reset at `cycleEnd`), GitHub Copilot (calendar month → counters reset on 1st of month). 18 new tests in `estimate_test.go`. Frontend badges show "Reset Est." on all providers when reset time has elapsed.
- Missing model pricing now produces unavailable cost output instead of false zero-dollar spend.
- **Dashboard UI/UX cleanup** — Refactored Overview and Quotas tabs for better logical alignment. Removed redundant "Provider Status Signals" from Overview and injected readiness ratios natively into Quota tab headers (e.g., "44 accounts (21 ready)"). Made quota reset countdowns unconditionally visible for full/stale accounts instead of hiding them when resets have technically elapsed. Fixed a race condition causing the Advisor card and Countdowns to vanish if Overview tab loaded before quota data.
- **Quota UI Refactor** — Overhauled the Quotas tab Status columns across all providers. Renamed "Status" to "Refresh In" and combined the colored health dot with the exact countdown timer into a single, compact pill (e.g., "● ↻ 3h 45m"), completely eliminating redundant text labels (Ready/Low/Empty). Sorting by the "Refresh In" column now intelligently sorts accounts by the soonest reset time.
## [0.29.0]

### Added
- **AI Cost Anomaly Detection (F5)** — Z-score engine (`internal/forecast/anomaly.go`) with rolling 30-day window. Detects spend spikes >2σ above average. Severity classification: warning (2-3σ), critical (>3σ). Budget projection estimates monthly excess. `GET /api/anomalies` endpoint. Frontend alert card with dismiss (localStorage). 8 new tests.
- **Notification Digest Mode (F8)** — `DigestBatcher` collects multiple quota alerts within a configurable time window (default 5 min) and flushes as a single summary. Batch-on-write pattern with early flush at 5 alerts. Thread-safe via `sync.Mutex` + `time.AfterFunc`. Delivers digests via all 4 channels (OS, SMTP, Webhook, WebPush). `ConfigureDigest()` engine method. 6 new tests.
- **Sparkline KPI Integration (F2)** — wired existing SVG sparkline renderer into Monthly AI Spend card (7-day trend) and Token Analytics KPI cards (Total Tokens, Est. Cost). Trend direction arrows (↑/↓/→) with semantic coloring.
- **Chart Annotations / Event Markers (F19)** — activity events rendered as visual markers on the history chart timeline. Maps 10+ event types (config changes, account additions, subscriptions, budget, alerts) to color-coded icons. Hover tooltips, auto-limited to 10 visible markers. Filters high-frequency noise (snapshots, polls).
- **Shareable Monthly Spend Report (F16)** — Canvas-based PNG export (1200×630px). Dark-themed report with hero metrics (total spend, top category), stat cards (providers, snapshots, active days, best streak), 30-day activity trend bars. DPR-aware rendering. Zero dependencies — native Canvas API. Download via "📊 Monthly Report" button in Export card.

### Changed
- Overview content order: Safe to Spend → Anomaly Card → Countdown → Advisor → Cost KPI → Token Analytics → ...
- CSS: 3 new stylesheets (anomaly, annotations, sparkline integration)
- Export card: added Monthly Report PNG button alongside CSV/JSON

## [0.28.0]

### Added
- **Safe to Spend guardrail (F1-UX)** — hero card showing remaining budget with semantic color coding (healthy/warning/over), daily burn rate, and projected overspend. CSP-safe event binding (no inline onclick). Full-width layout in overview grid.
- **SVG sparkline renderer (F2-UX)** — pure SVG micro-charts with trend direction detection (↑/↓/→). Zero dependencies, theme-aware via CSS variables.
- **Beautiful empty states (F3-UX)** — preview cards with sample data for Quotas, Subscriptions, and Overview tabs. Replaces blank screens for new users with actionable CTAs.
- **Usage streak hero card (F4-UX)** — prominent display of current streak, total snapshots, active days, and best streak. Rendered above the activity heatmap (replaces duplicate stats bar).
- **Reset countdown chips (F6-UX)** — inline countdown timers for providers with quota resets within 24h. Auto-refreshes every 60s.


### Fixed
- **Token Usage Analytics CSS** — added complete missing stylesheet for KPI cards, range selector, model distribution bars, daily burn chart, and breakdown chips. Previously had no CSS at all (pre-existing bug).
- **Gemini CLI model breakdown CSS** — added missing styles for per-model rows (`cursor-model-breakdown`, `cursor-model-row`, `quota-minibar`). Previously rendered as unstyled raw content. Applies to both Gemini CLI and Cursor providers.
- **CSP inline handler violations** — replaced all inline `onclick` handlers with CSP-safe `addEventListener` wiring for budget modal buttons.
- **Activity section data duplication** — removed old stats bar from heatmap (streak card now shows the same data in a better format).

### Changed
- Overview content order: Safe to Spend hero → Countdown → Advisor → Cost KPI → Token Analytics → Git Costs → Heatmap → Provider Health → Insights
- CSS entry point: 3 new stylesheets (ux-features, sparklines, token-analytics)
- Provider model breakdown: upgraded from flexbox to CSS Grid layout with larger font (13px) and taller progress bars (7px)

## [0.27.0]

### Added
- **Rate limiting middleware** — per-IP token bucket rate limiter on all mutation endpoints. Three tiers: `snap` (10/min), `mutate` (30/min), `import` (2/min). Returns `429 Too Many Requests` with `Retry-After` header. Zero external dependencies — uses `sync.Mutex` + background cleanup goroutine.
- **Config type validation** — `PUT /api/config` validates values against declared schema types (`bool`, `int`, `float`) with range enforcement: `poll_interval` 30-3600, `retention_days` 30-3650, `notify_threshold` 5-50. Rejects malformed input with `400 Bad Request`.
- **Copilot Quota UI** — GitHub Copilot now renders on the Quotas tab with Premium and Chat dual usage bars, plan badge, status dot, and provider accent color (`#6e40c9`). Header badge counts Copilot. Provider/status filter includes Copilot.
- **Full import parity** — `POST /api/import/json` now imports all 7 provider snapshot types (Antigravity + Claude + Codex + Cursor + Gemini + Copilot + Plugin) with ±500ms dedup per provider. `ImportResult` extended with per-provider counters.
- **Parallel polling** — auto-capture agent now runs all 7 providers concurrently via `sync.WaitGroup` with semaphore(4) concurrency limiter. Poll cycle time reduced from O(sum) to O(max). Per-provider elapsed time logged at debug level.
- **Notification TTL reset** — `ResetGuard()` and `ResetAllGuards()` methods on the notification engine. Quick Adjust now calls `ResetAllGuards()` after successful adjustment, re-arming all quota alerts immediately.
- **Plugin configuration observability** — plugin configuration changes now log structured activity events. Manual HTTP plugin execution was later removed; current builds return `410 Gone` for `POST /api/plugins/{id}/run`.
- **28 new tests** — 16 import tests, 5 config validation tests, 5 rate limiter tests, 2 notification guard reset tests.

### Security
- **MCP endpoint hardened** — now enforces `--auth` basic auth and rejects cross-origin browser requests (Origin validation)
- **Activity log masking** — sensitive config values (PAT, passwords, VAPID keys) are masked with `***` in change logs
- **Config key validation** — `PUT /api/config` rejects unknown keys to prevent arbitrary data injection
- **Rate limiting** — all snap, config mutation, and import endpoints rate-limited per IP

### Fixed
- **JSON export** — now includes all 7 provider snapshot tables (Codex, Cursor, Gemini, Copilot, Plugin) + pretty-printed output
- **Notification guard** — uses 6h TTL expiry instead of permanent suppression for non-Antigravity providers
- **Quick Adjust** — uses direct `GetSnapshotByID` instead of O(N) scan; added `io.LimitReader` body limit; re-arms notification alerts
- **Config validation** — `notify_threshold` range check moved from `int` to `float` case to match schema declaration
- **Copilot status** — now included in unified `/api/status` response (parity with 4 other providers)
- **Stale TODOs** — removed completed TODO for rate limiting; converted 2 remaining TODOs to design notes (N23, N24); eliminated all TypeScript `any` types

### Changed
- 170+ tests across 18 files in 10 packages (+28 new tests from hardening sprint)
- Poll cycle architecture: sequential → concurrent with semaphore(4)
- Import architecture: Antigravity-only → all 7 providers with per-provider counters

  - `UpdateSnapshotModels` store method with full DB round-trip
  - `latestSnapshotId` exposed in AccountReadiness for frontend reference
- Tests: `TestUpdateSnapshotModels`, `TestUpdateSnapshotModels_NotFound`

### Fixed
- **Removed Heartbeat RPC** — was a no-op (connection keep-alive, not a cache invalidator); removed to eliminate wasted latency before every snap
- **ideName fix** — LS payload corrected from `windsurf` to `antigravity`, ensuring proper quota data matching
- **Protobuf `*float64` handling** — correct treatment of `remainingFraction` where protobuf zero means 0% (exhausted), not null (missing data)
- **Reset-time-corrected aggregation** — group-level calculations (Claude+GPT total) now use time-adjusted model values instead of raw snapshot data
- **Account dimming logic** — dimmed by `isReady` flag instead of `allExhausted`, fixing visual inconsistency between fresh and stale snapshots
- **Provider collapse persistence** — collapse/expand state baked into HTML generation, preventing flash-expand on filter change
- **Subscription tab white flash** — pre-load data on init, removed re-fetch from tab switch handler
- **Tab animation flickering** — removed `tabFadeIn` CSS animation causing background color flash during DOM re-paints

### Removed
- `cloudapi.go` — dead-end direct Google Cloud API integration (unreliable token extraction from `state.vscdb`)
- `cmd/apitest/`, `cmd/dbprobe/`, `cmd/usstest/` — experimental test tools
- `Source` field from `UserStatusResponse`, `DataSource` field from `Snapshot` — no longer needed without cloud API dual-path
